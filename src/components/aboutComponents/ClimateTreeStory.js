      <p className="about-paragraph">
        ClimateTree&trade; was conceived in 2019 by GIS expert Greg Schundler
        and climate literacy and policy specialist Abby Ruskey as a tool to help
        address the climate crisis from the person out to the global community.
        ClimateTree&trade; was inspired by the UNFCCC Paris Agreement,
        “magnitudes of scale” researchers, Olympia high school students, and
        climate strikes led by youth globally with the vision that students and
        concerned community members could partner with local and state elected
        officials and other leaders to move policy and financing for the steps
        needed to meet greenhouse gas reductions. ClimateTree&trade; seeks to be
        this and so much more; truly a “tech and teach for the commons” climate
        change mitigation and adaptation solutions exchange.
