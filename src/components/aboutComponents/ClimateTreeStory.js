      <h2>ClimateTree&trade; Story</h2>
      <p>
        ClimateTree&trade; was conceived in 2019 by GIS expert Greg Schundler
        and climate literacy and policy specialist Abby Ruskey in response to
        global-scale ecological crisis, global climate strikes, and the inertia
        of international climate politics. The first prototyping of the tool was
        done with high school students and their teacher in Olympia, Washington,
        who, having helped demand and pass a City-wide climate change
        resolution, were asked to advise their city government on the adoption
        of appropriate climate change mitigation and adaptation solutions.
      </p>

        The ClimateTree&trade; website was co-designed, developed and launched
        in 2020 by Northeastern University Master’s students in Advanced
        Software Development. Their Professor, Dr. Ian Gorton, Chair of Computer
        Science, discovered ClimateTree&trade; and Greg at a “tech for good”
        event sponsored by Mark Frischmuth’s DemocracyLab.org.
