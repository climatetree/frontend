      <h2>What is ClimateTree&trade;?</h2>
      <p>
        Myriad climate change solutions and resilience stories are bubbling up
        around the world- from people just like you, in places just like yours.
        They are found in neighborhoods, in small businesses, research
        universities and schools, in cultural traditions and new technologies,
        on the front page of local newspapers, and in viral videos - from the
        center of the city to the remote countryside.
      </p>

      <p>
        ClimateTree&trade; is a timely climate solutions crowdsourcing project
        that empowers people in communities of all scales and types to find,
        share, discuss and apply climate change solutions through policy,
        financing, business innovation teaching, creating art and more! Using
        the latest in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), web-platforms, and
        social media technologies, ClimateTree&trade; recognizes that every
        person on planet earth has a role to play and whatever your
        socio-economic position is, you can make a BIG difference when equipped
        with this tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        We invite you to “spin the globe” and explore what’s happening within
        and beyond your community and/or city. Perhaps you are a student who is
        frustrated with the glacial pace of change and would like to see your
        city council members take bolder action. ClimateTree&trade; will give
        you the tools to approach city officials as a partner with practical,
        applicable climate solutions policies and financing strategies. At the
        same time, you can search and upload information or stories about
        climate change mitigation or adaptation approaches from within your
        community and help them to see and celebrate what is already taking
        place. And, as you search for comparables of your place, upload and tag
        content, comment on what you see, you may even meet one or more new
        friends from across the world!
      </p>
      <p>
        But this tool is not only for students and concerned community members;
        it is also designed for educators, business leaders and governmental
        agencies and support services dedicated to helping your community become
        a resilient and thriving place doing it’s part to greenhouse gas
        emissions and sequester carbon for a healthier future for all!
