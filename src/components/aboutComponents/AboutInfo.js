      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Myriad climate change solution stories are bubbling up around the world-
        from people just like you, in places just like yours. They are found at
        research universities and schools, in cultural traditions and new
        technologies, on the front page of local newspapers, and in viral videos
        - from the center city to the remote countryside.
      </p>

      <p>
        ClimateTree is an innovative project that empowers communities of all
        scales and types to find, share, and discuss climate change solutions
        using the latest in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), web-platform,
        and social media technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spin the globe and explore what’s happening anywhere, find stories by
        climate change mitigation or adaptation solution, search for comparables
        of your place, upload and tag content, comment on what you see, or meet
        a new friend across the world!
      </p>

      <h2>ClimateTree Story</h2>

      <p>
        ClimateTree was launched in 2020 by Northeastern University Master’s
        students in Advanced Software Development. Their Professor, Dr. Ian
        Gorton, Chair of Computer Science, found the project through the “tech
        for good” organization DemocracyLab.org founded by Mark Frischmuth.
      </p>

      <p>
        ClimateTree was conceived in 2019 by Greg Schundler and Abby Ruskey in
        response to global-scale ecological crisis, global climate strikes, and
        the inertia of international climate politics. The first research was
        done with high school students in Olympia, Washington, who, having
        helped demand and pass a City-wide climate change resolution, were asked
        to advise their city government on the adoption of appropriate climate
        change mitigation and adaptation solutions.

      <h2>A Reflection from Space</h2>

      <p>
        ClimateTree was inspired by a desire to help Earthlings live in harmony.
        You humans have always pondered ways to flourish and improve, while
        reducing suffering and avoiding disaster. Innovation, violence, and
        migration have been rotating solutions to your limits and problems. Yet,
        modern global-scale threats such as nuclear annihilation and ecological
        collapse have made conflict and migration increasingly untenable. Here
        you are. The time is now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of humanity’s brightest minds have contemplated a planetary
        migration and began searching for Plan-et B in the sky centuries ago -
        in recent decades with the NASA Keppler mission. Whether searching for
        planets like yours or researching what it would take to seed a barren
        planet in your own star system (you call it Mars), you have developed a
        deep scientific understanding of the very special parameters, and their
        relationships, that make life, and humanity’s flourishing, possible on
        Earth: solar energy, water, geothermal heat, and the presence of special
        elements, to name a few. This has been termed the Goldilocks effect –
        Earth seems to be just right.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet most of you cannot affect planetary political or economic processes.
        You live in houses and apartments, villages and cities, in watersheds of
        the water planet, within political administrative units like counties,
        states, and nations, connected by urban extents and through global
        trade. And while you are diverse genetically, culturally, and
        spiritually – you are all human. You share your planet with other
        Earthlings - plants, fungi, animals, protists, and bacteria - all
        sentient creatures that help sustain you and each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Humans have produced and shared an incredible legacy of data, knowledge,
        and opinion about what it means to be human and how to flourish as such.
        There are reams of perspectives on the optimal parameters to produce
        happiness, comfort, wealth, harmony, sustainability, freedom, peace,
        security, equality, success, and other human ideals. These parameters
        describe relationships between self, others, and nature at, and across,
        many spatio- temporal scales.
      </p>

      <p>
        GIS technology, Big Data, the Internet, social media, and global travel
        have given you all, at once, an ability to search your own planet for
        people just like you and places just like yours. So while the telescopes
        and satellites keep searching out there, you have the ability to search
        around here, and within yourselves, to learn from people and places just
        like you.
      </p>

      <p>
        ClimateTree gives any Earthling the ability to adjust Goldilocks
        parameters at any scale to find a village, city, county, state, or
        nation just like theirs. With a lead, you might just find a story, a
        civilization, a community, an individual that has a solution to a
        problem you have now. How did they do it?
      </p>

      <p>
        No human seems to be able to believe in a solution without first seeing
        - or believing- that it is possible. If you ever find a planet like
        yours or a way to make Mars green, you know that most of you would not
        board a spaceship flying there without some assurances that you would
        survive. And so it on Earth and in your lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such an inquisitive, practical, and cautious species will likely have a
        few more questions along the way. How much does it cost? What resources
        will we need? How long will it take? Are we there yet?
      </p>

      <p>
        ClimateTree creates the tools for your planet’s inhabitants to dive deep
        into discussion and collaborative research, sharing the data and stories
        that describe the practical and plausible paths to a better way of life,
        across all parameters and at all scales.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forget the pie in the sky - what are your favorite recipes here on
        Earth?
