      <h2>A Reflection from Space</h2>
      <p>
        ClimateTree&trade; was inspired by a desire to help Earthlings live in
        harmony. You humans have always pondered ways to flourish and improve,
        while reducing suffering and avoiding disaster. Innovation, violence,
        and migration have been rotating solutions to your limits and problems.
        Yet, modern global-scale threats such as nuclear annihilation and
        ecological collapse have made conflict and migration increasingly
        untenable. Here you are. The time is now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of humanity’s brightest minds have contemplated a planetary
        migration and began searching for Plan-et B in the sky centuries ago -
        in recent decades with the NASA Keppler mission. Whether searching for
        planets like yours or researching what it would take to seed a barren
        planet in your own star system (you call it Mars), you have developed a
        deep scientific understanding of the very special parameters, and their
        relationships, that make life, and humanity’s flourishing, possible on
        Earth: solar energy, water, geothermal heat, and the presence of special
        elements, to name a few. This has been termed the Goldilocks effect –
        Earth seems to be just right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet most of you cannot affect planetary political or economic processes.
        You live in houses and apartments, villages and cities, in watersheds of
        the water planet, within political administrative units like counties,
        states, and nations, connected by urban extents and through global
        trade. And while you are diverse genetically, culturally, and
        spiritually – you are all human. You share your planet with other
        Earthlings - plants, fungi, animals, protists, and bacteria - all
        sentient creatures that help sustain you and each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans have produced and shared an incredible legacy of data, knowledge,
        and opinion about what it means to be human and how to flourish as such.
        There are reams of perspectives on the optimal parameters to produce
        happiness, comfort, wealth, harmony, sustainability, freedom, peace,
        security, equality, success, and other human ideals. These parameters
        describe relationships between self, others, and nature at, and across,
        many spatio- temporal scales.
      </p>
      <p>
        GIS technology, Big Data, the Internet, social media, and global travel
        have given you all, at once, an ability to search your own planet for
        people just like you and places just like yours. So while the telescopes
        and satellites keep searching out there, you have the ability to search
        around here, and within yourselves, to learn from people and places just
        like you.
      </p>
      <p>
        ClimateTree&trade; gives any Earthling the ability to adjust Goldilocks
        parameters at any scale to find a village, city, county, state, or
        nation just like theirs. With a lead, you might just find a story, a
        civilization, a community, an individual that has a solution to a
        problem you have now. How did they do it?
      </p>
      <p>
        No human seems to be able to believe in a solution without first seeing
        - or believing - that it is possible. If you ever find a planet like
        yours or a way to make Mars green, you know that most of you would not
        board a spaceship flying there without some assurances that you would
        survive. And so it on Earth and in your lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such an inquisitive, practical, and cautious species will likely have a
        few more questions along the way. How much does it cost? What resources
        will we need? How long will it take? Are we there yet?
      </p>
      <p>
        ClimateTree&trade; creates the tools for your planet’s inhabitants to
        dive deep into discussion and collaborative research, sharing the data
        and stories that describe the practical and plausible paths to a better
        way of life, across all parameters and at all scales.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forget the pie in the sky - what are your favorite recipes here on
        Earth?
